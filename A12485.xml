            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> were to weigh one vnknowne thing by an other. But the weights of Prudence and right rea≈øon are both commun and euident to all, &amp; therfor the weighinge of religions by them mu≈øt needs be mo≈øt generall, mo≈øt ea≈øie, and mo≈øt effectual with all ≈øortes of people. And if anie refu≈øe to haue their religion tried by the≈øe kinds of weights,<note place="margin">VVhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is again≈øt vvi≈ødom and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is follie.</note> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe therby that they fear their religion to be contrarie to wi≈ødome and rea≈øon, which is as much as to be fabulous and fooli≈øh. For what can be oppo≈øit to wi≈ødome and rea≈øon but follie and fables?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nether let anie think that that religion which is mo≈øt agreable to Prudence and the light of rea≈øon, is not al≈øo mo≈øt agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture. Becau≈øe rea≈øon and Scripture are both God his word and Gods truth, the one naturall, written by his owne hand in our ≈øoules by creation; the other ≈øupernatural, written in paper

For as God doth not by his grace de≈øtroie the naturall inclination of our will to good but perfecteth it: So by his word and faith he extingui≈øheth not but increa≈øeth the naturall in≈øight which our vnder≈øtanding hath of truthe. yea ≈øuch is the force of our vnder≈øtanding to pearce into Gods truth as that by it the Philo≈øophers (as the Apo≈øtle witne≈ø≈øeth Rom. 1.) came to know <hi>the inui≈øible proprieties of God and his euerla≈øting power &amp; diuinitie.</hi>

And this dealing of Iuell with Saint Au≈øtin bringeth me in mynde of his damnable writing again≈øt the Catholick faith.

But no maruell if ≈øtrange and vnheard of ≈øhifts be found to maintaine falfe doctrine. For ≈øaith he: <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> 1. <hi>epi≈øt.</hi> 91. <hi>inter epi≈øt. Aug. confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth he had no authoritie to call one poore Briton out of this Realme.

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:177762:60"/>2. But the fir≈øt of the≈øe proofes is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt vntruth, and the ≈øecond a meere folly. For vntrue is it, that Saint Innocent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed he had not authoritie to call one out of Britany. For the Briton of whome he ≈øpake was Pelagius the heretick, who at that tyme was not in Britany, but in Pale≈øtine, as te≈øtifyeth Saint Au≈øtin <hi>epi≈øt.</hi> 32. writen the ≈øame yeare, which was <hi>an.</hi> 416. Nether had Pelagius bene in Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long tyme before that. For as Baron ≈øheweth <hi>an.</hi> 405. out of Saint Chry≈øo≈øtom and I≈øiodor Pelu≈øiot. He was brought vp in the Ea≈øt, and after that liued, as Saint Au≈øtin ≈øaith <hi>epi≈øt.</hi> 95. <hi>longe tyme in Rome,</hi> where being di≈øcouered, he fled, as Baron telleth <hi>an.</hi> 412. into Sicilie, and thence into Pale≈øtine, where (being by his hypocri≈øy and fraud ab≈øolued from here≈øie, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fauor at the Bi≈øhop of Hieru≈øalem, but contrariwi≈øe condemned by Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Zozimus) he ≈øtayed, and for any thing I finde ther dyed. For if him ≈øelf had brought his here≈øy into Britany, Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. Would neuer haue a≈øcribed the bringing of it to one Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola long after. And therfor I doubt of that which Bale <hi>cent</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. citeth out of Walden. that Pelagius was <hi>√† ≈øuis Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis pul≈øus in exilium ob here≈øim,</hi> vnles by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing into bani≈øhment he ment keeping
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177762:61"/> out of the Contrey, as perhaps Pelagius was. Be≈øides Innocent ≈øaith not, that he had not authoritie to call Pelagius where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øoeuer he were, yea he in≈øinuateth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but that Pelagius if he were ob≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat would not come at his call, and that others, that dwelt nerer to him myght do it more conueniently, than he who dwelt ≈øo far of as Rome is from Pale≈øtine. His words are the≈øe, <hi>Qui Pelagius ≈øi confidit, &amp;c. VVhich Pelagius if he tru≈øt and knowe that he de≈øerueth not to be condemned of vs, becau≈øe he reiectets that which he taught, he ≈øhould not be ≈øent for of vs, but he him≈øelfe ≈øhould make haste that he may be ab≈øolued. For if he think yet as he did, when will he pre≈øent him≈øelfe to our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon any letters what≈øoeuer, knowing that he ≈øhalbe condemned?

But authority to preach or ≈øend preachers to England was more likly to be in Saint Gregory, than any other Bi≈øhop. For touching the Patriarchs or Bi≈øhops of the Ea≈øt, it is a thing vnheard of, that any of them ≈øhould haue iuri≈ødiction ouer England. And as for the Bi≈øhops of France, certain it is they neuer had any authority ouer England. And the ≈øame I may ≈øay of Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Flanders, Spaine, and all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The doubt onely may be of Britons, becau≈øe they once had authority ouer the Contry,<note place="margin">No Bishop could se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d preachers to Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d but the Pope.</note> which the Engli≈øh po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed.

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:177762:235"/> Ethelbert changed his Pagani≈øme into the Roman religion, as is before ≈øhewed, but becau≈øe the Lord Protector and his complices thought it mo≈øt ≈øutable to their humors, and mo≈øt fit for their a≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pretences.

Con≈øider I pray thee now the number of the≈øe kings which is aboue 120, far aboue the ≈ømalle≈øt number of two Prote≈øtant Princes. Con≈øider their ≈øex and age, who almo≈øt all were men and of mature yeares, VVheras of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant Princes, one was a childe, the other a woman. Con≈øider their wi≈ødome and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:177762:237"/> valour, in which they were inferior to no Princes in Chri≈øtendome. Con≈øider their vertue, which was ≈øo great, as there are more Kings of Ingland Saints, than of all Chri≈øtendome be≈øides. Con≈øider the end for which they fir≈øt embraced the faith, which was nether to enioy their lu≈øt, nor to get any Church goods, nor to a≈ø≈øure their temporall ≈øtate, but to gaine heauen. Con≈øider the Coun≈øellors, who≈øe adui≈øe they followed herein, were not ignorant and laye men, but vertuous and learned Diuines. Con≈øider the motiues which drew them to the Catholick reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to witt, rare vertue, great learning, admirable miracles of their fir≈øt preachers. Finally, con≈øider how long they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in their faith, to wit almo≈øt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand yeares, and how almo≈øt in euery Kings time here liued ≈øome notable men, who with rare vertue and miracles haue confirmed their faith.</p>
                  <p>Con≈øider I ≈øay all this, and then iudge whither the Catholick religion of ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ≈øo worthie Kings, or the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant faith of one Child and one woman, be more likely to be good and to come from God. Can we thinke that ≈øo many Princes of mature yeares and iudgment ≈øhould be blinde, rather then one child &amp; a woman, that the≈øe could ≈øee that in ≈øo
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:177762:237"/> few yeares which all they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in a thou≈øand? That the≈øe two ≈øhould hit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> Gods truth for temporall endes, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they for ≈øpirituall? That that ≈øhould be Chri≈øts faith wherto the≈øe two were moued by wordly (if not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious) motiues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that wherto they were moued by heauenly vertue and miracles?

Finally that a Child and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man are gone to heauen, &amp; ≈øo many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Princes with all their Archbi≈øhops Bi≈øhops Prelats Diuins and Clergy, with all their Queenes, Princes, Nobles Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Ance≈øtors for the≈øe thou≈øand yeares, not with≈øtanding all their wi≈ødom, learning, miracles, vertuous liues, and good deedes are gon to hell for want of true faith in Chri≈øt? were (as the ancient Father Tertullian ≈øaith to certain Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of his time) ≈øo many millions chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtened in vaine, beleeued in vaine, ≈øerued God in vaine, and are dead in their ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Perhaps ≈øome will ≈øay that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øayd Princes and our Ance≈øtors beleeued ≈øo much of the Chri≈øtian faith as is nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to ≈øaluation. But then it euidently followeth that the Prote≈øtant faith is not the Chri≈øtian faith. Becau≈øe (as I haue
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:177762:238"/> ≈øhewne before out of the confe≈øsion of Prote≈øtants) tho≈øe Princes knew not ≈øo much of Prote≈øtancy as that which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants account the <hi>≈øoule head and foundation</hi> of their religion and without which they ≈øay all is lo≈øt, To wit, Iu≈øtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> by onely faith. Yea they are by Fox &amp; others plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed to haue known the Prote≈øtants faith, and affirmed to haue held diuers pointes quite oppo≈øit to Prote≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cy. How then could they be ≈øaued by any point of Prote≈øtancy who knew not ≈øo much as the foundation therof, and with other points of their beliefe ouerturned it? Wherfore others a≈øhamed to condemne ≈øo many, ≈øo worthy, and ≈øo vertuous Chri≈øtians to Hel, and yet not daring to afford them hope of ≈øaluation le≈øt they ≈øhould condemne their owne religion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere, that they will not iudge their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, but leaue them to Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the≈øe ether are a≈øhamed to vtter what they thinke, or haue no firme faith at all. For if they firmely belieued their Prote≈øtant faith to be Chri≈øts faith they mu≈øt needs thinck that all that haue died without it are damned, for without true faith it is impo≈øsible to plea≈øe God, or (which is a ≈øpice of Athei≈øme and right Antichri≈øtianitie) that there are more waies to heauen than by Chri≈øt and his

THus we ≈øee mo≈øt deerly beloued Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that if we compare according to the true rules of prudence and wi≈ødome, the Roman Catholike &amp; Prote≈øt. religion in their fir≈øt founders here in our Engli≈øh Nation, other for learning or vertue, for mi≈øsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> or orders for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to preache, for vniuer≈øalitie of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øsion of Aduer≈øaries, for miracles or ≈øucce≈øsion and continuance, the Catholik religion is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably to be preferred &amp; cho≈øen before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t. For if learning do help to e≈øpie truth S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtin was liklier to find it than Luther, If vertue de≈øerue to haue truth reuealed, S.

Or if con≈øent of Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, Confe≈øsion of Aduer≈øaries. Miracles &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance make any thing for proofe of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, S. Au≈øtins religion is incomparably before Luthers.

And contrariewi≈øe if ignorance leade to lies, if vice hinder the reuelation of Gods truth, or cau≈øe the taking of it away, Luther is more lyke to erre than S. Au≈øtin.
