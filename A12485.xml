            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> were to weigh one vnknowne thing by an other. But the weights of Prudence and right reaſon are both commun and euident to all, &amp; therfor the weighinge of religions by them muſt needs be moſt generall, moſt eaſie, and moſt effectual with all ſortes of people. And if anie refuſe to haue their religion tried by theſe kinds of weights,<note place="margin">VVhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is againſt vviſdom and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is follie.</note> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe therby that they fear their religion to be contrarie to wiſdome and reaſon, which is as much as to be fabulous and fooliſh. For what can be oppoſit to wiſdome and reaſon but follie and fables?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nether let anie think that that religion which is moſt agreable to Prudence and the light of reaſon, is not alſo moſt agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture. Becauſe reaſon and Scripture are both God his word and Gods truth, the one naturall, written by his owne hand in our ſoules by creation; the other ſupernatural, written in paper
<pb facs="tcp:177762:4"/> with the hands of his holie Scribes by reuelation.<note place="margin">The agreable<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of Religion and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> And therfor though theſe two words be of different degree they can not be contrarie, but rather as twinnes of one and the ſelf ſame parent haue great ſympathie and connexion together. For as God doth not by his grace deſtroie the naturall inclination of our will to good but perfecteth it: So by his word and faith he extinguiſheth not but increaſeth the naturall inſight which our vnderſtanding hath of truthe. yea ſuch is the force of our vnderſtanding to pearce into Gods truth as that by it the Philoſophers (as the Apoſtle witneſſeth Rom. 1.) came to know <hi>the inuiſible proprieties of God and his euerlaſting power &amp; diuinitie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Paul.</note> And ſith we ſee that men by the light of reaſon know ſo much of other moral vertues as without all other teaching they perceaue in manie things what is honeſt, what diſhoneſt, what iuſt, what vniuſt, what is vertue, what vice, why ſhould we doubt that God hath giuen to vs equal knowledge of matters of religion and worſhip of him ſelf. Which vertue as it is the cheefeſt of all morall vertues, ſo the knowledge therof is moſt neceſſaire of them all vnto vs. Yea S.

            <p n="4">4.

<pb facs="tcp:177762:6"/> ſupernaturall thinges are, vnleſſe god had prouided ſome certayne authoritye, wherby we might be aſſured of that way, we could neuer be certayne therof but euer either erringe or doubtful.

            <p n="5">5. And on the other ſide as he hath ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed our will with a naturall taſte and reliſhe of vertue, wherby of nature we abhorre all vice and loue vertue. So alſo hath he infuſed into our vnderſtandinges a proportionable and correſpondent light and naturall inſight of truth, which ſheweth vnto the will, which is indeed vice, which vertue. This light cheiflye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in certaine generall principles of vertue which God hath giuen to our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge as it were rules and ſquares to direct it ſelfe in particular actions, by meanes of which it is aſſured that what is agreable to them is true and vertuous, and what diſagreable falſe and naught, and what ſeemeth to be moſt ſutable to them, moſt likelie to be true and good. Of theſe kind of principles for choyce of

And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wiſe amongſt all religions, what we ſee moſt agreable to them, that we may thinke moſt likelie to be Gods Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

            <p n="7">7. In this firſt parte I proue that the Romane Catholique,<note place="margin">Se l. 1. c. 2. l. 2. cap. 1.

Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins great learning.</note> though we had no euident teſtimony, we might our ſelues gather by many waies. For as touching his wit, and capacitie of learning, it may ſuffice that he was an Italian, and Roman,<note place="margin">His vvit.</note> whome in wit we know to excell. The place where he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177762:37"/> was Rome,<note place="margin">His place of ſtudie.</note> where at that tyme as Ioan. Diacon. <hi>in vit. Gregor. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>Rerum ſapientiâ cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeptem artibus floruit.</hi>

Firſt, becauſe after this war Saint Auſtin ordained Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus and Mellitus Biſhops, as Beda (ſaith he) reporteth. Secondly, becauſe they are not in the Saxon Tranſlation of Beda made by King Alfred. Thirdly, becauſe the Chronicle of Peterbrough and Flores Hiſtor. teſtifye, that Saint Auſtin dyed three yeares after this execution.<note place="margin">Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> But this ſurmiſe of forgerie in Saint Beda his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Hiſtory is altogeather incredible, both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe all Latin copies (in which lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage Saint Beda wrote) haue the ſayd words, and impoſsible it is that ether one forger ſhould corrupt all the copies in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177762:47"/> Chriſtendome, or that in all Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome men would agoe to corrupt Beda in that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> place, and in no other. And alſo becauſe till Sutclif no man ſuſpected any ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Finally, becauſe, as it ſhall appeare anon by true Chronologie of tyme, Saint Auſtin was indeed dead befor the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And no little preſumption therof it is, that the Britons, who layd the blame therof on King Ethelbert Saint Auſtins ſcoller, would ſoner haue layd the blame therof on Saint Auſtin himſelfe <hi>who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> (ſaith Saint Beda) <hi>prophecied it,</hi> if he had bene aliue, as King Ethelbert was, when it chauced. But little will he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to hear Sutclife to ſuſpect Saint Beda as corrupted, who conſidereth how many and how vndoubted bookes of Fathers in his Challeng he had reiected as ether forged or corrupted,<note place="margin">Vſuall vvith Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clif to ſay Authors are forged</note> as Saint Athanaſ. <hi>de vita Antonij,</hi> Saint Hierom <hi>de vita Pauli &amp; Hilarionis,</hi> S.

Which kinde of ſhift, at it is moſt vſuall with Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clif, ſo in the eye of any wiſe man it is moſt deſperat. As for his proofes, the firſt is a manifeſt vntruth.<note place="margin">Sutc. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieth S. Beda.</note> For Saint Beda repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not that S. Auſtin ordained Biſhops after the ſaid ſlaughter of the Britiſh Monkes, but onely talketh of the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before he ſpeaketh of the ordination.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177762:47"/> The cauſe wherof was, becauſe hauing tould of Saint Auſtins prophecie of the Britons deſtruction, which prophecie was before he ordained Biſhops, to ſhew that it was a true prophecie addeth, that after it hapened as S. Auſtin had fortould, and how long after, he ſoone after decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to wit, long after S. Auſtins death. Sutclifs ſecond proofe I greatly ſuſpect to be a forgerie of his owne. But how ſo euer that be, ther is nether reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he ſhould vrge, nor that we ſhould beleeue one tranſlation before all originalls.<note place="margin">Originals to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations &amp; many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one.</note> For who would not think that, that tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlation were defectiue in that place, rather than that all Originalls had more than they ſhould. As for the Chronicle of Peterbrough and Flores Hiſtor. wee might take iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt them, as hauing paſt through the corrupt fingering of diuers Proteſtants, but who are they to oppoſe againſt ſo many cited before to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, eſpecially ſeeing that Flores Hiſtor. cleareth Saint Auſtin from this ſlaughter, and attribueth it to Prophecie. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Chronologie (as Godwin in the Biſhops of York <hi>pag.</hi> 442. a Proteſtant confeſſeth) <hi>is very vncertain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the British Monks vvere ſlaine.</note> &amp; in this point is very falſe. For as Sigebert <hi>in Chron.</hi> and Bale him ſelf <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 74. reporteth out of Maſſeus the ſlaughter was done <hi>an.</hi> 615.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177762:48"/> At what tyme as all writers agree S. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was Archbiſhop, and Saint Auſtin dead,<note place="margin">VVhen S.

How then could Saint Auſtin cauſe this ſlaughter, which was ſo long after his death, and much les goe in the army to the ſlaughter as Sutclif citeth out of an ould Chronicle, if he do not lye himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For this Bilſon in his Booke of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>pag.</hi> 114. ſaith, that the King Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert King of Kent (whome Saint Auſtin conuerted) mooued King Ethelfrid to commit this maſſacre, and citeth therto Galfrid of Munmouth <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. and ſo indirectly deriueth the faulte to Saint Auſtin his teacher.<note place="margin">That K. Ethelbert cauſed not the British Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to be ſlaine.</note> But firſt, if this ſlaughter were done (as we haue ſeene out of Bale) in the yeare 615. certain it is, that Saint Auſtin liued not till that tyme, but dyed before, as is alredy ſhewed, and therfore he could not be the author of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fact. Secondly, in defence of King Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert I oppoſe againſt Bilſon what Fox ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 119.<note place="margin">Fox defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth King Ethelbert.</note> 
                  <hi>that it ſeemeth rather ſuſpicious than true, that Ethelbert being a Chriſtian King, ether could ſo much preuaile with a Pagan Idolater or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177762:48"/> els would attempt ſo far as to commit ſuch a cruell deede.</hi> And in truth who ſo conſidereth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the diſpoſition of that Pagan King in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. where he is compared <hi>to a rauening wolfe,</hi> will eaſely ſee, that he needed no ſtirrer vp to make war againſt the Brito<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And therfor Fox <hi>loco cit.</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribeth it to the <hi>fierſe furie of Ethelfrid,</hi> which was ſo great as he is ſirnamed <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> Beſides that K. Ethelbert was more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> potent than King Ethelfrid, for he had all the South part of England at command, as teſtifyeth Saint Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. and Ethelfrid onely the North. And therfor if he would haue reuenged Saint Auſtin by war, and bloodſhed, he would rather haue done it him ſelfe, than ſtirred an other Heathen King againſt them. But this good King was ſo far from cauſing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Britons to be murdered, becauſe they would not receaue S. Auſtins doctrine, as that, (as writeth Saint Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 26.) <hi>he would not force his owne ſubiects to receaue it.</hi> As for Galfrid ther is no ſuch thing in the place cited by Bilſon, which argueth that he cited it out of Iuell without ſeeing the booke. But indeed <hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 13. Galfrid ſaith that Ethelbert excited Ethelfrid to goe to Bangor and deſtroy Abbot Dimoth &amp; other Monkes, who had reſiſted S. Auſtin. But Galfrid is a very fabulous Author, the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177762:49"/> firſt broacher of Merlins Prophecies,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cambd. in Brit. p.</hi> 8. calleth his hiſtory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epties foo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leries, and his book is forbide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Councell of Trent.</note> and of other incredible fables, and liued many hundred yeares after Saint Beda, who te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyeth <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. that King Ethelfrid came not of purpoſe to kill the Monkes, (but to get Cheſter, as he, <hi>loco cit.</hi> and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesbury <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Reg. c.</hi> 3. do inſinuat) and being to ioyne battell with the Britons, eſpying the Monkes at prayer, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they came to pray againſt him, ſet firſt vpon them, and ſlew them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſecond fault, which Miniſters impute to S. Auſtin,<note place="margin">That S. Auſtins not riſing to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded not of pride.</note> is pryde, becauſe he ſat ſtil in his chaire when the Britiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Deuins came to confer with him. True it is, that S. Auſtin did ſo, but that it proceeded not of pryde appeareth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe nether S. Beda nor any Engliſh or foraine writer vnto our times beſides the Britons (who were hereticks then, &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly moſt proude themſelues) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> imputed it to pryde. Secondly, becauſe Saint Auſtin and his fellowes, as them ſelues write in Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Honored the Brito<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce while they thought they were Catholicks.</hi> Therfor Saint Auſtins not riſing to them proceeded not of pride, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but of ſome other iuſt cauſe. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Britiſh Prieſts were ſuch then, as they deſerued no honor, yea much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor, and therfore it could be no pride
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177762:49"/> in S. Auſtin to giue them none.<note place="margin">VVhat kind of men they vvere to vvhome S.

Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. calleth them <hi>vnfaithfull, naughty and deteſtable people.</hi> And Gildas their owne Contry man ſaith, that they were <hi>wolues, enemies of truth, and friends to lyes, enemyes of God, and not Prieſts; merchants of miſcheef, and not Bishops, Impugners of Chriſt, and not his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, more worthy to be drawn to priſon, or to the cage, than to Prieſthood.</hi> And much more of the like ſorte. And Fox addeth out of an ould Chronicle Acts <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 114. that <hi>all things whether they pleaſed or diſpleaſed God, they regarded alike, and not onely ſeculer men did this, but their Bishops &amp; teachers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction.</hi> Which being ſo I appeale to the iudgement of any indifferent man, whether theſe men deſerued any honor at S.

The cauſe therefor why he aroſe not to them,<note place="margin">vvhy S.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177762:51"/> in this point. Thirdly, I ſay, that ſuch a feare it was as Saint Auſtin and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany manfully ouercame,<note place="margin">S.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177762:51"/> his enemyes, but the vngratfull Engliſh hereticks Iuell hath impoſed vpon him. And if Cham were iuſtly accuſed of his Father for reuealing his carnall Fathers ſhame, what deſerueth he who falſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth vpon his &amp; vpon all Engliſh mens ſpirituall Father, <hi>for</hi> (to vſe Saint Paules words) <hi>in Chriſt Ieſus he begat vs through the Goſpell,</hi> ſhamefull crimes neuer imputed to him by his enemies. And this dealing of Iuell with Saint Auſtin bringeth me in mynde of his damnable writing againſt the Catholick faith. For a little before his death he charged his Chaplin named Iohn Garbrand, that as ſone as he was dead,<note place="margin">Iuel vvro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te againſt his ovvne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> Garbrand ſhould publiſhe to the world, that what he had written, he had done againſt his owne knowledg &amp; conſcience onely to complie with the State, and to vphould that religion which it had ſet vp. And albeit Garbrand did not for feare pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this ſo openly as he was charged, yet did he auouch it to diuers in Oxford. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this is a Proteſtant of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whome I could name, yet liuing at Lewis in Suſſex, who tould it to two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Gentlemen of whome I learnt it. And the more credible this is, becauſe I could name a Miniſter, a Doctor,<note place="margin">Learned Miniſters impugne knovvne truth.</note> and of great account among the Miniſters, who confeſſed to a freind of his, of whome I
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177762:52"/> heard it, that he taught againſt the truth and his owne knowledg. And the ſame he doubted not to affirme of the reſt of his brethren that are learned. And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhewed that Saint Auſtin had great learning and vertue, requiſit for a firſt preacher of Chriſts faith vnto Infidells: let vs ſee what authority he had to preach and how he was ſent to do it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That S. Auſtin was mooued with holy motiues to come to preach to our Nation.</head>
               <p>ALthough what can be ſaid of this matter, will be clear inough, partly by what hath bene already ſaid, partly by what ſhall hereafter: yet becauſe it helpeth much to the perfect iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of religions, to know what mooued the firſt Authors &amp; Founders of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try to preach &amp; publiſh them, for therby they may iudg of their ſincerity or fraudulent meaning, and whether they ſeeke the glory of God, and ſaluation of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, or their owne good: Therfore I will declare now what motiues Saint Auſtin had to teach vs his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:177762:52"/> religion, and afterward, in the Second Booke, what motiues likewiſe Luther had to teach vs his. Firſt therfore, Saint Auſtin could not be mooued by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motiue or ſpur of all Archereticks or Sect-maiſters to <hi>abducere diſcipulos</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith of them) <hi>post ſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vaine glorie moued not. S. Auſtin.</note> that is to be the head and founder of a Sect, becauſe (as ſhalbe ſhewed anon) his religion was the vſuall and common religion of all Chriſtendome in his tyme. Secondly, he could no be mooued in hope of honor,<note place="margin">Nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note> for in Rome he was head of his monaſtery, &amp; in England among a fierce, ſtrange &amp; barbarous Nation, he could expect none. Wherfore albeit (beyond all humaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) he was made Archbiſhop, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no hope therof, that can not be iuſtly thought to haue moued him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that voyage. Thirdly, profit could not moue him to this enterpriſe. For what profit could he expect here, or what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit did he expect, who (as Saint Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Nor profit</note> 
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 26. ſaith of him and his fellowes) <hi>deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the commodities of this world as things none of their owne, taking of them whome they inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, onely ſo much as might ſerue their neceſsities.</hi> And being made Archbiſhop did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as Saint Gregory appointed him in Beda <hi>lib,</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. liue according to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious rule, not a part from his Clergie,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:177762:53"/> but <hi>followed that trade and forme of liuing which was vſed in the primitiue Church among the Fathers, among whome there was none that ſaid that to be his owne, which he poſſeſſed, but all things were comon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 And as for worldly pleaſur what ſhould moue Saint Auſtin (think we) to leaue his natiue Contry,<note place="margin">Nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> and to ſeeke pleaſure in a ſtrange Contry, where he knoweth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, perſon nor language? What pleaſure ſhould moue an Italian to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge Italy for England, Rome for Canterbury, eſpecially when our Contry (as then it was) was ſauage and barbarous? What pleaſure can we imagin can moue a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to goe to preach Chriſts faith among barbarous infidells? Or what pleaſure did Saint Auſtin ſeeke here who with his fellowes liued here ſo Angel like, that as Saint Beda writteth <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>maruailed much at their ſimplicity, of their innocent liuing, and our King was then much delighted with the puritie of their life and the example of their godly conuerſation.</hi> And being Archbiſhop, yet left not his religious life, and as is before ſhewed, tooke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding paines in teaching, and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing our Nation, and wonderfully labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to conuert the Britons alſo. Who (as is before ſaid) went ſtill on foote, and for the moſt part barefoote, and had his

                  <hi>CHAPT. VIII.</hi> That Saint Auſtin was lawfully ſent hither to preach, prooued by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers authorities and confeſsion of Proteſtants.</head>
               <p>TWO things ther are required to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawfull Paſtor, to wit, both right Orders, and lawfull Commiſsion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacraments and Word of God. And albeit by order of doctrine, wee ſhould ſpeake firſt of Saint Auſtins orders, yet becauſe his Commiſsion being cleared, his orders will eaſely appeare to be good, I will ſpeake firſt of his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion where with he was ſent to preach. And that he was ſent of Saint Gregory, wee need not prooue. For as Sutclif ſaith in his Subuerſion <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>It is not denied, that Gregory ſent Auſtin.</hi> The onely difficulty can be whether he were lawfully ſent, and by ſufficient authoritie or no.<note place="margin">Hovv ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vvayes S: Auſtins miſsion is prooued.</note> But that he was lawfully ſent to preach I will prooue firſt by ſacred teſtimony from Heauen; Secondly, by authority of Catholicks; Thirdly, by confeſsion of Proteſtants; Fourthly, by examples; and laſtly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177762:54"/> The teſtimony from Heauen is of Saint Peter,<note place="margin">By S Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> who appearing in a viſion to Saint Laurence ſucceſſor of Saint Auſtin, when he vpon the reuolt of our Contrie to Paganiſme intended to abandon the Land, <hi>ſcourged him</hi> (ſaith Saint Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.) <hi>with ſharp ſtripes a great while in the cloſe night, and asked why he would forſake the flock which he him ſelf had committed vnto him.</hi> Behould Saint Peter from Heauen teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted English men to the teaching of Saint Laurence, one of Saint Auſtins fellow labourers, &amp; whome Saint Auſtin him ſelf appointed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated for his ſucceſſor. And <hi>when Saint Laurence awaked</hi> (ſaith Godwin) <hi>he found it more than a dreame, for all his body was gore blood. VVherfore going immediatly to the King Edbald, he ſhewed him his woundes, and together related to him the occaſion of them, which ſtrook ſuch a terror into the King, as by and by he renounced his Idolls, and cauſed him ſelf to be baptized.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of S Peter to be true.</note> Now that this apparition to S. Laurence was no dreame or illuſion appeareth many wayes.

Secondly, by the authority of Saint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Laure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, who being ſo holy a man would neuer auouch an idle dreame, or illuſion for a certain viſion.

Fifthly, by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of S.

For Feild <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>of the Church, cap.</hi> 1. ſaith: <hi>In the tyme of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen Councell, and before, as appeareth by the Acts of the Councell, there was three principall Bishops or Patriarchs of the Chriſtian world, namely the Bishop of Rome, of Alexandria, of Antioch.</hi> Thus breefly yow ſee the Popes Patriarchat ouer the Weſt granted to be moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and lawfull. Hence I argue thus. A Patriarch hath authority to ſend prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to all partes of his Patriarchie: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Pope had authority to ſend preachers to England,<note place="margin">England euer vnder the Popes Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chat.</note> which is a parte of the Weſt. The Antecedent none can deny. The Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent notwithſtanding Bilſon <hi>lib. cit. pag.</hi> 320. doth ſtrangly deny. But no maruell if ſtrange and vnheard of ſhifts be found to maintaine falfe doctrine. For ſaith he: <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> 1. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 91. <hi>inter epiſt. Aug. confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he had no authoritie to call one poore Briton out of this Realme. And the Britons would yeeld no ſubiection to Auſtin the Romish Legat.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for England was not within the compas of the Popes Patriarchat.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:177762:60"/>2. But the firſt of theſe proofes is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vntruth, and the ſecond a meere folly. For vntrue is it, that Saint Innocent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he had not authoritie to call one out of Britany. For the Briton of whome he ſpake was Pelagius the heretick, who at that tyme was not in Britany, but in Paleſtine, as teſtifyeth Saint Auſtin <hi>epiſt.</hi> 32. writen the ſame yeare, which was <hi>an.</hi> 416. Nether had Pelagius bene in Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long tyme before that. For as Baron ſheweth <hi>an.</hi> 405. out of Saint Chryſoſtom and Iſiodor Peluſiot. He was brought vp in the Eaſt, and after that liued, as Saint Auſtin ſaith <hi>epiſt.</hi> 95. <hi>longe tyme in Rome,</hi> where being diſcouered, he fled, as Baron telleth <hi>an.</hi> 412. into Sicilie, and thence into Paleſtine, where (being by his hypocriſy and fraud abſolued from hereſie, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fauor at the Biſhop of Hieruſalem, but contrariwiſe condemned by Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Zozimus) he ſtayed, and for any thing I finde ther dyed. For if him ſelf had brought his hereſy into Britany, Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. Would neuer haue aſcribed the bringing of it to one Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola long after. And therfor I doubt of that which Bale <hi>cent</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. citeth out of Walden. that Pelagius was <hi>à ſuis Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis pulſus in exilium ob hereſim,</hi> vnles by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing into baniſhment he ment keeping
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177762:61"/> out of the Contrey, as perhaps Pelagius was. Beſides Innocent ſaith not, that he had not authoritie to call Pelagius where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoeuer he were, yea he inſinuateth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but that Pelagius if he were obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat would not come at his call, and that others, that dwelt nerer to him myght do it more conueniently, than he who dwelt ſo far of as Rome is from Paleſtine. His words are theſe, <hi>Qui Pelagius ſi confidit, &amp;c. VVhich Pelagius if he truſt and knowe that he deſerueth not to be condemned of vs, becauſe he reiectets that which he taught, he ſhould not be ſent for of vs, but he himſelfe ſhould make haste that he may be abſolued. For if he think yet as he did, when will he preſent himſelfe to our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon any letters whatſoeuer, knowing that he ſhalbe condemned? And if he were to be ſent for, that might be better done of them who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, than ſo far of as we are. But there ſhall want no care of him if he will be cured.</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:177762:61"/> not long before Saint Auſtins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming were the Popes Legats, as writeth Galfrid a man of good account among Proteſtants <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Dubritius</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Primat of Britannie, and Legat of the See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick was famous with ſuch great pietie.</hi> And had Palls from Rome, as is euident in the life of Saint Sampſon. Nether did the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Britons refuſe to be ſubiect to Saint Auſtin, becauſe they thought Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie to haue no authoritie to apoint an Archbiſhop ouer them, (for vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would haue alleadged this as a reaſon of their refuſal if they had ſo thought it) but onely becauſe, as Saint Beda reporteth <hi>lib</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">VVhy the Britons refuſed to be vnder S.

               <p>Secondly I prooue it by reaſon groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſcripture.<note place="margin">Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in proofe of S.

But authority to preach or ſend preachers to England was more likly to be in Saint Gregory, than any other Biſhop. For touching the Patriarchs or Biſhops of the Eaſt, it is a thing vnheard of, that any of them ſhould haue iuriſdiction ouer England. And as for the Biſhops of France, certain it is they neuer had any authority ouer England. And the ſame I may ſay of Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Flanders, Spaine, and all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The doubt onely may be of Britons, becauſe they once had authority ouer the Contry,<note place="margin">No Bishop could se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d preachers to Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d but the Pope.</note> which the Engliſh poſſeſſed. But that could yeald them no ſpirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer the Engliſh in Saint Auſtins tyme, becauſe nether was the Engliſh euer ſubiect to the Britons, nor was ther in Saint Auſtins tyme any Britiſh Biſhop
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:177762:62"/> aliue who had had any dioceſe within England: Therfore they could at that tyme clayme no more authority to ſend Preachers into England, than the Biſhops of Wales can now. Wherfore if this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was then in any Biſhop (as needes it muſt be) it was in the Biſhop of Rome, who euer ſince the primitiue tyme of the Church hath vſed to ſend preachers hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as is before ſhewed.

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. As for the firſt of Reinolds cauils. It is no more againſt Peters Apoſtleſhip to be

And for the ſecond, Irenaeus doth not call Linus firſt Biſhop of Rome, but onely ſaith that Peter, and Paul gaue him the Biſhoprick to gouern the Church, to wit vnder Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in his abſence.

Vpon that Rock do I know the Church was built, who ſoeuer ſhall eate the lambe out of this houſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</hi> Note how he ſaith, that he followeth firſt Chriſt, and next the Pope, and that the reaſon, which he giueth herof after, was not why he followed Chriſt firſt, for that were needles to proue amongſt Chriſtians; And if he would haue giuen any, it would haue bene,<note place="margin">Hierom follovveth the P. next after chriſt becauſe Chriſt made the P. the rock of his Church.</note> becauſe Chriſt is God; But the reaſon which he giueth, was why he followed the Pope next to Chriſt, to wit, becauſe he knew him to be the Rock, on which the Church was built. Wherby it is euident, that by the Rock, he meant not Chriſt, as Bilſon <hi>lib. de Obed. pag</hi> 87. and others would, but Pope Damaſus as Reinolds co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth <hi>p.</hi> 370. 376. But yet he meant not (ſaith Reinolds) the ſucceſsion of the Popes, becauſe Hierom writeth that Pope Liberius had before
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:177762:72"/> ſubſcribed to Arianiſme. But if Hieroms words be well po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered he will be found to haue ſaid, both that Pope Damaſus was the Rock, and that his ſucceſsion to Saint Peter in his Chaire of Rome, was the cauſe why he was the Rock. For if a ſubiect writing to the King ſhould ſay: <hi>Nullum primum niſi Deum ſequens maiestati tuae, id est, Throno Conqueſtoris (in temporalibus) conſocior. Super illam petram aedificatum Angliae Regnum ſcio. Quicumque extra hanc domum aliquid egerit, rebellis est.</hi> He ſhould confeſſe that both the King were head of the Realme, and with all tell how he came by that authority, to witt, by ſucceſsion to the conqueror. So Saint Hierome in the forſaid words both ſayd that Pope Damaſus perſon, which he meant by <hi>Beatitudini tuae,</hi> was the Rock on which in his tyme, the Church was built: and ſayd with all that his perſon had that authoriry by his ſucceſsion to Saint Peter in his Roman Chaire, and therfore added theſe words, <hi>id eſt, Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drae Petri,</hi> as a further explication of the former. And conſequently he meant that the Church is built vpon all Popes that lawfully ſucceed in the Chaire of Peter. Which is ſo euident as Doct.

For <hi>pag.</hi> 570. he ſaith, that <hi>the words of Auſtin (ep. cont. Donat.</hi> and Hierome <hi>ep. cit.) do import a ſincerity of faith in the Roman Bishops to their tyme,</hi> which would not be true, if Liberius had fallen. But admit I ſay it were true, that Liberius had denyed his faith, that maketh no more againſt his Rock ſhip, than the like fault in S. Peter did againſt his. For as S. Peter though he denyed his faith, yet taught not infidelitie as he was Apoſtle, and Paſtor of the Church, ſo nether Liberius though he committed a perſonall crime, yet taught he no hereſie, as ſucceſſor to S.

Secondly he ſaith, that though it be <hi>ipſa,</hi> and grammatically agree with the ſubſtantiue <hi>Petra,</hi> which followeth, yet it may be meant of Peters perſon. But if Saint Auſtin had meant that Peter alone had bene the Rock, and that his ſucceſſors partaked nothing with him in that, he would neuer haue byd vs number his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors too, and then tell vs that that was the Rock.

But to our purpoſe all is one, that in Saint Auſtins iudgment Peters Seat (that is Peters ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in Seat) are either the Rock of the church,<note place="margin">Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</note>

               <p n="13">13. Thirdly, Theodoret an ancient and Grecian Doctor writing to Renatus, ſaith of the Roman See: <hi>Tenet enim ſancta Sedes gubernacula regendarum cuncti orbis Eccleſiarum.

               <p n="1">1. THat S.

Beda, who ſaith he was created by the Biſhop of Arles, becauſe France was of the writers of that tyme called Germanie, as appeareth by Venantius Fortunatus <hi>in Carmine de Nuptijs Sigeberti &amp; Brunechildae,</hi> which might be,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177762:74"/> partly becauſe the French at that tyme and long after gouerned a great part of Germany, partly alſo becauſe the Francks who then ruled in France were Germans come out of Germanie. But to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.<note place="margin">That S. Auſtin vvas rightly ordered.</note> That S. Auſtin was rightly created Prieſt appeareth, by that he was made by the authoritie of S. Gregory, or his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, whome proteſtants account to haue bene true Biſhops of Rome. And Doct. Reinolds <hi>Confer. pag.</hi> 362. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Pope to haue yet Biſhoply power ouer his owne Dioceſſe. S. Auſtin therfore being a Roman, and made by the Biſhoply authoritie of the Pope, was rightly made Prieſt. And in lyke ſort it may be proued that he was rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated a Biſhop. For he was made by the authoritie of the Pope with the conſent of the King of England. Secondly I proue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that S. Auſtin was lawfully conſecrated Biſhop by the conſent of the Chriſtian world. For S. Greg. commanded him to be made Biſhop, the French Biſhops made him, the Engliſh Chriſtians receaued him, and the Eaſt Church, to whome S. Greg. wrote of the matter, neuer diſliked him, and all the Chriſtian world hitherto hath approued him. Nether did the Britons (though enemyes) take any exceptions againſt his orders. Thirdly becauſe all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:177762:75"/> proteſtants call S. Auſtin a Biſhop, and number him firſt in the Catalogue of the Archbiſhops of Canterburie. And if their Biſhops and Miniſters will haue any orders at all, they muſt confeſſe that S. Auſtins orders were good, and ſufficient. For as Doct. Feild ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>of the Church cap.</hi> 39. <hi>In England they which had bene Bishops in the former corrupt ſtate of the Church</hi> (ſo he termeth Catholick tymes) <hi>did ordaine Bishops and Miniſters.</hi> And Sutclif. anſwer to exceptions <hi>pag.</hi> 88. ſaith. <hi>Couerdal and Scory</hi> (who were Biſhops in King Edwards tyme) <hi>layd hands vpon Bishop Parker.</hi> Bel in his Funerall profeſſeth openly that he hath not departed from the ſubſtance of his Popiſh orders, but onely from the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies therof. Beſides, euident it is, that what Biſhop or Prieſt ſo euer had bene made in King Henries tyme, was neuer conſecrate a new in King Edwards dayes. Who had bene made in Queene Maries dayes was acounted to haue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient orders in Queene Eliſabeths Reigne. And yet what Prieſt apoſtateth from his faith is, without more orders, thought to haue orders ynough fore miniſtring the Sacraments and vvord of God, or prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants haue no order at all. And thus hauing ſhewed that S. Auſtin was the firſt Preacher of Chriſtian fayth to our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177762:75"/> Engliſh Nation, and that he had both ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient learning and vertue to diſcharge ſuch a function, and withall lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion and right orders to adminiſter the Sacraments, and preach the word of God; now let vs ſee what kind of faith and religion it was, which he preached; and firſt what kind in generall, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward what it was in particuler.</p>

Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins miracles.</note> I would haue the Reader to conſider, firſt that ſome of them were then liuing, as S. Greg. the Britons, and Authors of the Epitaph. Others liued after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as the reſt. Secondly, ſome were forrein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as S. Greg. others Domeſtical in England. Thirdly ſome are publick as the Epitaph, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> others priuat. Fourtly ſome were enemyes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to S. Auſtin as the Britons, the others, freinds. Fiftly, ſome were great Clercks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> as S. Greg. S. Beda, and ſome of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, who by their learning could iudg of the miracles; others of leſſe account. Sixtly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſome were great Saints, as S. Greg. and S. Beda were, who would not deliuer an vntruth, or vncertain fables for true and certain miracles; others of meaner qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Seuenthly ſome were eye witneſſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> as the Britons (and they enemyes too who would finde what falt they could) and the authors of the Epitaph; others by report. Laſtly ſome are Catholicks, ſome Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:177762:87"/> And what greater variety of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or better qualified witneſſes, would we aſke to beleeue a thing than theſe be?</p>
               <p n="6">6. This great weight and varietie of witneſſes we haue to beleeue that S. Auſtin did theſe things which are accounted miracles,<note place="margin">No author before our Daies nor reaſon againſt S.

And to the contrary ther is no Author, forrain or Domeſtical; eye witneſſe or other; freind or foe; Catholick or Proteſtant, before our daies: nor any reaſon at all beſides that which Fulk Anotat. in Io. 14. giueth againſt S.

Let vs not beleeue any Records or Hiſtories of times paſt,<note place="margin">See S. Auſt. <hi>lib.</hi> de vtil cred. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</note> no that euer there was ſuch a man as S. Auſtin. And for times preſent, let vs beleeue no Iurie, nothing done in far Contries, nothing done out of our preſence, no not that ſuch were our parents, becauſe none of theſe are written in Gods word, but are deliuered to vs by human authoritie, to which (as they ſay) we are not bound to giue credit. Thus yow ſee to what inconueniences this kind of ſenſles reaſon would lead vs, if we ſhould follow it in other lyke mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But beſides, it is fond in it ſelfe, for it is taken from negatiue authoritie: <hi>which kind of argument</hi> (ſaith Iuel Art. 2. Diu. 13.) <hi>Vnles it be in conſideration of ſome other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ſo ſimple as that a verie child may ſoone anſwer it.</hi> And iuſtly,<note place="margin">Negatiue authoritie no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> for negatiue authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is no authoritie, and ſilence no witneſſe. Whervpon the law ſaith. <hi>Qui mutum exhibet nihil exhibet;</hi> eſpecially when the ſilence is of ſuch which had no cauſe to ſpeake of the matter, as the ſcripture had none to fortel S. Auſtins miracles. And therfor to argue from ſuch negatiue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is to argue from noe authoritie and to ſeeme to vſe reaſon, when indeed ther is none. For who would ſuffer a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:177762:88"/> Malefactor, againſt whome many honeſt men haue depoſed, to clear him ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diuers ſtanders by ſay no thing againſt him? Would their ſilence, which in any mans iudgment maketh no more for him than againſt him, be preferred before the depoſitions of diuers witneſſes <hi>omni exceptione maiores?</hi> And ſo, beſids that the ſcripture was written many hunderd yeares before S. Auſtin was borne and therfor could not ſpeak of his miracles but by prophecie, the ſilence therof in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles maketh no more againſt them than for them. For as it affirmeth them not, ſo nether doth it denie them. And therfor as Fulk argueth; The ſcripture affirmeth not S. Auſtins miracles; therfor they were not. An other might with as good reaſon ſay. The ſcripture denieth them not, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for they were. But leaueth them to the authoritie and credit of thoſe that report them. Which (as hath bene ſhewed) is as great as can be required to human beleefe: and therfor bindeth vs to giue human credit vnto them.<note place="margin">S. Auſtin.</note> For as S. Auſtin ſaid wel <hi>lib. de vtil. cred. cap.</hi> 16. <hi>It is miſerable to be deceaued by authoritie, but moſt miſerable not to be moued by it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A part of beaſts not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vvith authoritie.</note> Becauſe to be deceaued ether by probable reaſon, or ſufficient authoritie is a thing incident to man. But not to be moued with conuincent reaſon, or ſuch
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:177762:88"/> ſufficient authoritie, as no iuſt exception can be taken againſt it, hauing no reaſon or authoritie to the contrarie, is the part of a beaſte vncapable of reaſon, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For this cauſe, perhaps ſome will grant that S. Auſtin did theſe things,<note place="margin">That S. Auſtins miracles vvere true miracles.</note> which are reported of him, but yet will ſay, that they are not true miracles, but falſe, ſuch as may be done by nature, arte, or the Diuels helpe. But againſt theſe I oppoſe. Firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that they ſay this without the authoritie of any ancient writter at all or any other before our dayes.<note place="margin">See Alan. Copus Dial. 5. cap. 18.</note> Secondly they ſay it without any reaſon taken from the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them ſelues. For the ſudden cure of a blinde perſon, whome the Britons could not cure, what ſuſpition giueth it of a falſe miracle? That he was blind the Britons ſaw, that they could not cure him, them ſelues experienced. Thirdly I oppoſe the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> manes wherby S. Auſtin cured him, which was as Beda teſtifieth <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>By prayer to the Father of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, beſeeching that he would reſtore light to the blind perſon that by corporal illumination, and lightning of one man his ſpiritual grace might kindle many.</hi> Which meane of prayer to God, is quite oppoſit to the working of falſe miracles, which is by calling vpon the Diuel. Fourthly I oppoſe the ende for which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:177762:89"/> moſt of S. Auſtins miracles were done, which was to draw Pagans from Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to Chriſtianitie, and from vice to vertue, as the effect did ſhew. But the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel would do nothing (and much leſſe a miracle) to draw men from Infidelitie, and vice to which he enticeth them all he can; or to Chriſtianitie and vertue, from which he driueth them by all meanes that in him lyeth. Therfor S. Auſtins mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles came not from the Diuel. And this trial of miracles by the end of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants allow as the true touchſtone to try them by. As Fox Acts <hi>pag.</hi> 351. where he crediteth the miracle wrought in the king of Tartaria his child, which when it was born was vgly and deformed, and being Chriſtened became faire and bewtifull. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it ſerued to the conuerſion to the Chriſtian faith, to which vſe properly all true miracles do apertain.</hi> And yet that faith to which that King was brought, and for which that miracle was wrought was Papiſtical as Bale granteth <hi>cent.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 303.</p>
               <p n="8"> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 8. Fiftly I oppoſe the admirable, and by Proteſtants confeſſed holines of Saint Auſtin and his fellowes. What affinitie or commerce had ſuch great vertue with the Diuel; From which how far he was, ſo far was he from working thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:177762:89"/> which Auſtin and thoſe vertuous men did. Sixtly I oppoſe the iudgment of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> S. Gregorie, Beda, and other learned, and holy men hitherto who accounted them for true miracles. Who if learning, or vertue can deſcrie falſe miracles, were as like to deſcrie them as any now liuing. yea better, becauſe many of them were preſent, and might conſider many circun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which might help them to finde out the truth, which now we do not know. Seuenthly I oppoſe the iudgment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of the Britons amongſt whome ther were as S. Beda ſaith, <hi>plures viri doctiſsimi,</hi> and who all were oppoſit to S. Auſtin, and therfor they wanted nether ſkil, nor wil to diſcouer the falſitie of his miracles, if any had bene. Laſtly I oppoſe the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> of the fornamed Proteſtants, who hauing duly conſidered all circunſtances, haue not onely iudged, but confeſſed, written, and ſubſcribed that S. Auſtins miracles were true miracles <hi>wrought</hi> (as Fox ſpeaketh) <hi>through the hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. For this, perchance, ſome may be perſwaded to confeſſe that both S. Auſtin wrought theſe wonderous things which are recorded of him,<note place="margin">That a miracle can not be vvrought to confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me an vntruth.</note> and alſo that they be true miracles, and yet may ſay as Fulk doth Annot. in <hi>Marc.</hi> 9. <hi>That Hereticks may work miracles to confirm their erroneous opinions.</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:177762:90"/> That is direct blaſphemie againſt God. For a miracle can not be wrought but by God his diuine power, who vſeth it as a ſeal to confirm his Doctrin with. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon S. Paul. 1. <hi>cor.</hi> 12. called miracles <hi>ſignes of his Apoſtleship,</hi> And <hi>marc.</hi> 16. they are called <hi>confirmations from God,</hi> and our Sauiour Io. 5. <hi>calleth them a greater teſtimonie than S. Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> And biddeth the Iewes if they will not beleeue him, beleeue his miraculous works. And S.

And this Saint Auſtins miracles did proue ſufficiently, and it is all wee ſeeke. Thirdly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I ſay that S.

That bread and wine are by inuiſible power turned into Chriſts body and blood, and become after conſecration truly (not figuratiuly) his body and blood. And though the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the ſermon ad, that the ſacrament after conſecration <hi>is not bodily but Ghoſtly Chriſts bodie,</hi> yet the word <hi>ghoſtly</hi> is not added to deny the word <hi>(Truly)</hi> which is abſolutly affirmed, but onely to deny the word <hi>(Bodily)</hi> that is carnally and after a Capharnaitical maner which is Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick doctrin. For though the Euchariſt be truly and really Chriſts body, yet is it not Chriſts bodie after a carnal maner, but after a ſpirituall &amp; myſtical maner. Now wher he ſaith (which Bilſon <hi>lib.</hi> of Obed. <hi>pag.</hi> 681, and Proteſtants vrge) <hi>that holy how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel after bodily vnderſtanding, is a corruptible and mutable creature,</hi> maketh nothing againſt Tranſubſtantiation.

Anſelm, and by the teſtimonie of Proteſtants. Likwiſe moſt vntrue it is, that our moſt ancient Cathedrall Churches were places for married Prieſtes. For the moſt ancient of all is Chriſtchurch in Canterburie, wher King Ethelbert the firſt Chriſtian King of England placed monks (as Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face in his letter to him in Malmsb. <hi>lib.</hi> 1.

Laurence Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop who firſt ſucceded S.

Dunſtan. As for the firſt Cathedrall Church of Worceter, it was, (as Godwin ſaith in the Biſhops of Worceter) a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie built by S. Egwin. I ſay the firſt, For that which is now, was long after founded by S. Wulſtan Biſhop of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceter, as yow may ſee in his life in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win. Or if the firſt were built of Sex wolf (as Cambden ſaith in Brit. <hi>pag.</hi> 512. It is nothing likly that he would build it for married Prieſtes, ſeing (as Beda ſaith <hi>lib.</hi> 4 <hi>cap</hi> 6) he was a monke him ſelfe, and built that Monaſterie which now is called Peterborough. But eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nether then, nor long after there were any maried Prieſtes in England, as is euident by theſe words of S.

Which in other words is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:177762:157"/> to ſay, they did not marry.

King Edward the ſixt his ſonne, a child of nine yeares olde, which childe wanting the vſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reaſon, and vnfit to gouern him ſelf, was the firſt Proteſtant Prince that euer was in England, and turned the Roman religion which his Father had left, (though maimed in one principall point) to open Proteſtancie. Not for the miracles or rare vertues of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers therof, or their conuincing their aduerſaries in diſputation, as King
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:177762:235"/> Ethelbert changed his Paganiſme into the Roman religion, as is before ſhewed, but becauſe the Lord Protector and his complices thought it moſt ſutable to their humors, and moſt fit for their aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pretences. But how vnfortunat this exchange was, not onely to the ſoules of this King and principall Actors therin, but alſo to their liues and bodies, yow may reade in Stow,<note place="margin">The ill end of the kringets in of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſtancie.</note> where yow ſhall ſee that the very ſame yeare 1548. that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was made for receauing in both Kindes, the Lord Admirall (a cheefe agent in the change of religion) though brother to the Protector, and Vnkle to the King, was beheaded for a Traitor, And the next yeare 1549. VVhen Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made againſt Maſſe, ſone after alſo was Proclamation made againſt the Protector him ſelfe, the principall author of the change, and he caſt into the Tower. And in the yeare 1552. when the newe ſeruice booke of Common prayer begun in Pauls, the ſaid Protector was beheaded, And the next yeare the King died, and the Duke of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland (an other principall actor in the change of religion though againſt his own conſcience, as he openly declared at his death) was beheaded for treaſon, and Cranmer and Ridley and other fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:177762:235"/> of that change were depriued of their Dignities, and ſone after burnt. This was the rufull end of the firſt ſetters vp of Proteſtancie.

Conſider I pray thee now the number of theſe kings which is aboue 120, far aboue the ſmalleſt number of two Proteſtant Princes. Conſider their ſex and age, who almoſt all were men and of mature yeares, VVheras of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes, one was a childe, the other a woman. Conſider their wiſdome and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:177762:237"/> valour, in which they were inferior to no Princes in Chriſtendome. Conſider their vertue, which was ſo great, as there are more Kings of Ingland Saints, than of all Chriſtendome beſides. Conſider the end for which they firſt embraced the faith, which was nether to enioy their luſt, nor to get any Church goods, nor to aſſure their temporall ſtate, but to gaine heauen. Conſider the Counſellors, whoſe aduiſe they followed herein, were not ignorant and laye men, but vertuous and learned Diuines. Conſider the motiues which drew them to the Catholick reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to witt, rare vertue, great learning, admirable miracles of their firſt preachers. Finally, conſider how long they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in their faith, to wit almoſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, and how almoſt in euery Kings time here liued ſome notable men, who with rare vertue and miracles haue confirmed their faith.</p>
                  <p>Conſider I ſay all this, and then iudge whither the Catholick religion of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo worthie Kings, or the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant faith of one Child and one woman, be more likely to be good and to come from God. Can we thinke that ſo many Princes of mature yeares and iudgment ſhould be blinde, rather then one child &amp; a woman, that theſe could ſee that in ſo
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:177762:237"/> few yeares which all they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in a thouſand? That theſe two ſhould hit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods truth for temporall endes, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they for ſpirituall? That that ſhould be Chriſts faith wherto theſe two were moued by wordly (if not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious) motiues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wherto they were moued by heauenly vertue and miracles? That that ſhould be Gods truth which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan but the laſt day, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which hath continewed heere this thouſand yeares? Finally that a Child and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man are gone to heauen, &amp; ſo many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Princes with all their Archbiſhops Biſhops Prelats Diuins and Clergy, with all their Queenes, Princes, Nobles Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Anceſtors for theſe thouſand yeares, not withſtanding all their wiſdom, learning, miracles, vertuous liues, and good deedes are gon to hell for want of true faith in Chriſt? were (as the ancient Father Tertullian ſaith to certain Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of his time) ſo many millions chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened in vaine, beleeued in vaine, ſerued God in vaine, and are dead in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Perhaps ſome will ſay that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd Princes and our Anceſtors beleeued ſo much of the Chriſtian faith as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation. But then it euidently followeth that the Proteſtant faith is not the Chriſtian faith. Becauſe (as I haue
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:177762:238"/> ſhewne before out of the confeſsion of Proteſtants) thoſe Princes knew not ſo much of Proteſtancy as that which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants account the <hi>ſoule head and foundation</hi> of their religion and without which they ſay all is loſt, To wit, Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by onely faith. Yea they are by Fox &amp; others plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed to haue known the Proteſtants faith, and affirmed to haue held diuers pointes quite oppoſit to Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy. How then could they be ſaued by any point of Proteſtancy who knew not ſo much as the foundation therof, and with other points of their beliefe ouerturned it? Wherfore others aſhamed to condemne ſo many, ſo worthy, and ſo vertuous Chriſtians to Hel, and yet not daring to afford them hope of ſaluation leſt they ſhould condemne their owne religion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that they will not iudge their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, but leaue them to Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But theſe ether are aſhamed to vtter what they thinke, or haue no firme faith at all. For if they firmely belieued their Proteſtant faith to be Chriſts faith they muſt needs thinck that all that haue died without it are damned, for without true faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God, or (which is a ſpice of Atheiſme and right Antichriſtianitie) that there are more waies to heauen than by Chriſt and his
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:177762:238"/> faith, that there are many faiths, many baptiſms, many Chriſts, many Gods. From which irreligious athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme God deliuer my deere country.

Herupon Luther and diuers of the Auſtin Friers were ſore offended. And Luther more impatient than the reſt, for to ſpite the Dominicans, began firſt to preach, and after to publiſh concluſions againſt the valour of indulgences. That this was the true cauſe of Luthers
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:177762:264"/> new preaching, beſide the teſtimonie of al Catholick writers, appeareth partly by what hath bene already ſaid, partly alſo by what ſhall be rehearſed further out of Proteſtants.<note place="margin">Cooper.

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That Luther was moued by humane and naughtie motiues to preach Proteſtantiſme.</head>
               <p>VVHat can be ſaid of this matter is clear by what hath bene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the former Chapter, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding becauſe we will obſerue the like of Chapters in diſcourſing of Luther which we vſed of S. Auſtin let vs heere ſee what motiues Lut er had of beginning and continuing his Proteſtants doctrine. The firſt motiue of beginning his doctrine was as is ſhewed before, enuie and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Dominicans for hauing the publiſhing of the indulgences which was wont to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Auſtin Friers.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> And his motiue of continewing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding in his new Doctrine was his pride which wold not permit him to recant what himſelfe thought ſo ill of as he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuppreſſe and burie in perpetuall ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Beſid theſe principall motiues o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he had which ſet him forward in his new doctrine. For being before a Frier
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:177762:288"/> vnder obedience and bound to pouerty &amp; chaſtity, by his new doctrine he ſhaked of ſubiection, &amp; got licence to gather riches, to mary, to enioie the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tments of the world. To theſe motiues were added vain glorie the nurſe of all Archeretiks, to haue followers termed after him Lutherans, the applauſe of vulgar and licentious people, and ſuch like.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> That Luther was neuer ſent or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to preach Proteſtantiſme.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FOr the better vnderſtanding of that which ſhalbe ſaid in this Chapter we muſt note, firſt that it is not denied that Luther was once lawfully ſent to preach to wit to preach Papiſtrie. For Being made Doctor and Preacher of Diuinity by Catholicks he was by them ſent to preach their faith and doctrine. But it is denied that euer he was ſent to preach Proteſtancie, Secondly we muſt note that there are two kinds of ſending to preach, the one extraordinary by God alone as the Prophets and Apoſtles were
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:177762:289"/> ſent.<note place="margin">Diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſending. <hi>Naz. veru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt quod vnum eſt mendacium multiplex eſt.</hi> Luthe-not ſent to preach by his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat.</note> The other ordinarie by man alſo, but yet ſuch as God hath giuen authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vnto to ſend others. So were Timothy Titus &amp; all Paſtors in Gods Church ſince the Apoſtles. How Luther was ſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants can not agree. For ſome will haue him to haue bene ſent extraordinarily by man alſo, and of theſe ſome will haue him to haue bene ſent by this man, others by that, which variance alone if Daniel might be iudge wold deſcrie the vntruth of their tale. But God willing I will ſhew that Luther was ſent no way to teach Proteſtancie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Amongſt thoſe who affirme that Luther was ſent ordinarily by man, ſome ſay that he was ſent by his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat and Prince the Elector of Saxonie.<note place="margin">5 <hi>Sleid. Engl. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 10, ſaith the D. vvas at firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed vvith Luther and fol. 22. the D. profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Luhers doctrin See fol, 26,</note> But this can not be. Firſt becauſe Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick then Elector at the firſt <hi>nether encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> ſaith Fox <hi>pag.</hi> 771. <hi>nor ſupported Luther but often repreſented heauines and ſorrow,</hi> for his procedings. Secondly becauſe the Elector was a Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Catholick when Luther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; a whil after. How then cold he firſt ſend Luther to preach that doctrine which before Luther he nether beleued nor knew of? Thirdly becauſe power to preach is ſupernaturall and mere ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, becauſe it pertaineth to care of ſoules and their direction to a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:177762:289"/> end But the power of Magiſtrates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is naturall &amp; ciuil and pertaineth to dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of men to their natural end as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Heathen as to Chriſtian Princes. And who will ſay that Heathen can ſend men to preach and giue them care of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſoules. Againe who can giue power to preach and adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may alſo himſelfe preach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Sacraments, for none can giue what he hath not himſelfe. But woemen may be Princes who yet can not preach. Therfor Magiſtrats, can giue no power to preach. And this diuers learned Proteſt. do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> grant. For Bilſon <hi>l.</hi> of obed. approued by publik authority <hi>p.</hi> 296. plainly ſaith that <hi>their Bishops haue not their authority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prince</hi> and that <hi>the Prince giueth then not Commiſsion to preach, but only liberty and permiſsion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bilſon.</note> And 303. <hi>The charge</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which the Preachers and Bishops of England haue ouer their flock pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth not from the Prince.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 322. <hi>Princes haue no right to call or confirme preachers.</hi> which he repeateth <hi>p.</hi> 323. And Fulke <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Fulk.</note> 
                  <hi>The authority</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of ciuil Magiſtrates doth giue Bihops nothing that is peculier to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Miniſters.</hi> Finally howſoeuer ſoueraigne Princes cold ſend men to preach, yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects as that Prince Elector was to the Emperor, cold not againſt their ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes will ſend any. And therefore Luther
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:177762:290"/> nether was nor cold be ſent firſt, to preach of Duke Frederik.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">Luther not ſent by anie Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church.</note>3. For this cauſe, other ſay that Luther was se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by his Church. So Fulk <hi>in Ioan</hi> 10. But this is eaſily diſproued by what hath bene ſhewed before <hi>cap.</hi> 1. by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants confeſsion of the nullity, or at leaſt inuiſibility of their Church befor Luthers preaching. For howſoeuer he might be confirmed of a Church which himſelfe founded,<note place="margin">Ther muſt be a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preacher befor ther be a Proteſt. Church and no Church can ſend her firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note> yet cold he not be firſt ſent to preach of a Church which before he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched was not at all, or at leaſt was not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Wherfore I demand whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people ſent Luther to preach Proteſtancy? whiles they were Rom. Catholick? But that can not be for no man will ſend one to preach oppoſit doctrine to his. Or after that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his preaching had made them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants? But then had he preached before he could be ſent of them and they could not be his firſt ſenders.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Others finding no Proteſtant people or perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who could ſend Luther to preach Proteſtancy before he preached it are faine to flie to their vtter enemies, to wit the Roman Church, and ſay that ſhe firſt ſent Luther. So D. VVhitak. <hi>cont. Dur. pag.</hi> 820. Sutclif Anſwere to <hi>Except. pag.</hi> 88. Feild <hi>l.</hi> 3. of the Church <hi>c.</hi> 6. &amp; 39. Fulk <hi>in Rome</hi> 10. and Engliſh Poteſtants commonly,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:177762:290"/> thought ſome of them be aſhamed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it in plaine termes.<note place="margin">Luther not ſent of the Rom. Church.</note> Their only rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe no other can be found to ſend Luther. But if they meane of ſending to preach Proteſtancie, it is moſt falſe and incredible. Falſe, becauſe both P. Leo 10, and Emper. Charles 5. then ſpirituall &amp; temporall heads of the Rom. Catholicks forbad Luther to preach Proteſtancy, and the one condemned him as an heretik for ſo doing, the other outlaueth him. And incredible it is that the Rome Church ſhold ſend a man to preach a religion ſo oppoſit to hers as Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy is, this were for her to ſet one to cut her own threate. And if they meane of ſending to preach Papiſtrie that auaileth them nothing. For I hope they wil not ſay that authority or Commiſsion to preach one religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to preach the contrary, or that the Roman Church when ſhe gaue Luther authority to preach Papiſtry ment to giue him authority to preach Proteſtancy any more than Proteſt. Biſhops when they giue their Miniſter authority to preach Proteſtancy meane to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authority to preach Browniſme or Anabaptiſme. Beſids that the purer ſort as our Miniſters teach that <hi>Popish Prieſts haue no calling</hi> as you may ſee in Penry againſt ſome <hi>pag.</hi> 31. And in truth al Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſhold teach ſo if they

               <p n="1">1. THe due conſideration of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life of the firſt Preacher or founder of Religion in any Country, may giue to prudent men great light to deſcern whether his Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be good or bad, come from God or from the Diuel. For albeit vicious men do often times preach and continew the religion which vertuous men firſt founded, as we ſee that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Phariſies in Chriſts time taught the Doctrin of Moyſes, Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he bad the people to do what they taught, and in the day of iudgment there wilbe repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats who haue propheſied in Chriſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; yet notwithſtanding if we looke into the ſcriptures or Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories we ſhall not finde but that thoſe whome God ſent to be firſt founders of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: <hi>Mitiſsimus hominum qui ſunt ſuper terram. The moſt mildeſt man that was on earth.</hi> Such a one was S. Iohn Baptiſt whome he choſe to firſt ſound out the happy tidings of Chriſtian religion to the world. Such were his Apoſtles who forſooke all and followed him, euen Iudas when he cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe him for an Apoſtle, as S. Cyril in 6. <hi>Ioan.</hi> Hierom <hi>l.</hi> 3. cont. Pelag. and others tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch. S. Hierom proueth it inuincibly out of theſe words <hi>Ioan.</hi> 17. <hi>Father whome thou haſt giuen to me I haue kept and none hath peris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed but the ſonne of perdition.</hi> For if God the Father gaue Iudas to Chriſt, ſurely he was then good. And it may be prooued out of the 54. Pſalme, where he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically called <hi>a man of one mind, &amp;</hi> ſaid to haue walked in Gods houſe with conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And before Chriſt would licence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to preach to Nations, he bid them abide in Ieruſalem til they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with vertue from aboue, and made them as S. Paul ſpeaketh <hi>Idoneos Miniſtros Noui Teſtamenti. Fit Miniſters of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Such alſo were thoſe whome we call the Apoſtles of certain Nations, as to omitt others S. Patrick of Ireland. S. Ninian of
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:177762:319"/> Pictland, S. Palladius the firſt Biſhop of Scotland. And the cauſe of this proceeding of God in chuſing vertuous men to be the firſt promulgators of his lawe in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is manifould. Firſt becauſe it is more honorable for him to chuſe for inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of ſo notable a work of his, as is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of a Nation from infidelitie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> faith, and from ſeruice of the Diuel to his ſeruice, men that are like to him ſelfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than men that are like to the Diuel, his owne children rather than the Diuels children, his owne ſeruants rather than the Diuels ſlaues. Secondlie it is more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the end which God intendeth. For albeit God could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert a Nation to his faith without vertue or miracles of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Preacher or any other external help; Yet becauſe he <hi>disponit omnia ſuauiter diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth al things ſweetly.</hi> he vſeth theſe outward helps wherwith he knoweth men to be moſt draune to embrace his religion, which are vertue and miracles. Of which twoe though miracles be verie potent, yet vertue is more poureful, as S. Chriſoſtom ſheweth by the compariſon of S. Iohn Baptiſt and Appollonius Tyaneus. Of whome the one wrought no miracles as the ſcriptur ſaith, &amp; yet by his vertue ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the Iewes into ſuch admiration of him, as they doubted whether he were not the
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:177762:319"/> Meſsias of the world. And the other though he wrought many wonders, yet had fewe or no followers. And S. Chriſoſt. dout<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th not to ſay, that if the Apoſtles had not liued vertuoſly, notwitſtanding their great miracles, the world would haue counted them but ſeducers. And in the conuerſion of our Engliſh Nation, albeit the miracles of S. Auſtin and his fellowes did cooperat therto, yet S. Beda <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. attributeth it cheefly &amp; almoſt wholly to the vertue &amp; holines of their life. Thirdly this courſe is moſt proportionable &amp; agrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to the end for which God ſendeth Preachers to any Contry. For as the end of his ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is vertue to be engrafted in that Nation, ſo the meane moſt agrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſutable therto is vertue in the firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. Wherfore howſoeuer the Succeſſors or as S.

               <p n="2">2. And the contrary courſe of ſending wicked &amp; vicious men for firſt preachers of doctrine is vſuall to the Diuell, and wel be ſeeming him. For albeit vertuous men may vpon ignorance fall into ſome one or more errors, yet c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="576" facs="tcp:177762:320"/> by the Diuel to forſake their true faith and worſhip of God, vpon which all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is grounded. But thoſe who (as Saint Paul ſpeaketh of the Hereticks Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus and Philetus) haue already made ſhipwrack of a good conſcience, and aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned vertue, thoſe the Diuell puffeth vp with a proude conceit of their owne lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and picketh out for Sectmaiſters, &amp; for teachers of new doctrines. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howſoeuer Archereticks may for a time diſſemble vertue, as S. Auſtin wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of Pelagius, yet <hi>mendacia</hi> (as S.

Arius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he became an Archeretick was noted to be ambitious. Berengarius before he broched his hereſie was noted of enuie at other mens glorie. Wicklef, before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his doctrine was noted of anger, as writeth Godwin in the life of Archb. Simon Langhorn, &amp; is euident in Stow Chron. <hi>Anno</hi> 1376. Finally Luther before he publiſhed his new doctrine was noted of enuie againſt the dominica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Friers (as is before ſhewed) &amp; ſingularity. In ſo much as Fox <hi>pag.</hi> 770. writeth that his freinds did thinck euen before he fell from the

                  <hi>that he would alter and abolish that manner of teaching which then was vſed.</hi> Thus all Archereticks are branded with ſome notorious vice or other. And perhaps theſe Archereticks are the falſe Prophets whome our Sauiour gaue a marke to know by their life. For which cauſe alſo both the ſcriptures and Fathers haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the notorious vices of diuers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chereticks as a ſure token that ſuch men were not they whome God firſt ſendeth as preachers of a new doctrine, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to conuert a Nation to him.

Yea the caſting in of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation by the Diuel (which yet Fox da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not auouch) might wel haue bene done of the Diuels own accord. Of S.

For (beſides the teſtimony of the word of God which teſtified the miracles which we reade in ſcripture) what wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they to be accounted true miracles that any other miracles had? The Deedes were ſupernaturall, The effect of them was ſupernaturall &amp; diuine vz: the conuerſion of Infidells, The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of doing them holy, to wit prayer to God, The doers of them were Saints, The teſtimonie of theſe Deedes are of many, eye witneſſes, freinds, and foes, learned, &amp; vnlearned, holy, and Wicked, forrein and domeſticall, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed of diuers which refuſe S.

               <p n="1">1. THus we ſee moſt deerly beloued Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that if we compare according to the true rules of prudence and wiſdome, the Roman Catholike &amp; Proteſt. religion in their firſt founders here in our Engliſh Nation, other for learning or vertue, for miſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or orders for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to preache, for vniuerſalitie of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of Aduerſaries, for miracles or ſucceſsion and continuance, the Catholik religion is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably to be preferred &amp; choſen before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For if learning do help to eſpie truth S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin was liklier to find it than Luther, If vertue deſerue to haue truth reuealed, S. Auſtin was more likely to haue deſerued it tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luther, If holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues entice men to deliuer ſincerly what they knowe to be truth, S. Auſtin was liklier to deale ſo than Luther. If laufull Miſsion and true orders teſtifie a true preacher, S. Auſtin was more likly to be ſuch than Luther. Or if conſent of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, Confeſsion of Aduerſaries. Miracles &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance make any thing for proofe of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, S. Auſtins religion is incomparably before Luthers. And what I ſay of S, Auſtin in reſpect of Luther, may alſo be ſaid (as appeareth by what hath bene writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) of S. Auſtins followers in our Engliſh Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in reſpect of Luthers followers in the ſame Nation. And contrariewiſe if ignorance leade to lies, if vice hinder the reuelation of Gods truth, or cauſe the taking of it away, Luther is more lyke to erre than S. Auſtin. If worldly &amp; naughtie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues drawe men to deceaue others, Luther was more like to deceaue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Auſtin. If want of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miſsion &amp; right orders diſcrie a falſe Prophet, Luther is more like to be ſuch than S. Auſtin. And
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:177762:330"/> finally if want of conſent of Chriſtianitie, want of acknovvledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Aduerſaries, want of miracles and continuance, ſhew any thing the vntruth of of religion, Luthers religion is more lyke to be vntrue than S. Auſtins. And if any ſhall ſay that albeit Luther and the Proteſt. religion be inferior to S. Auſtin &amp; the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all theſe points aboue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, yet are they ſuperior in the word of God, which is to be preferred before all other conſiderations whatſoeuer. If (I ſay) any ſhall thus obiect. I requeſt him to conſider that one truth is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to an other, nor Gods word to right reaſon nor his ſpirituall light to the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor faith oppoſit to true prudence. And if therfor right reaſon light of nature, true prudence ſtand for S. Auſtin &amp; his religion, &amp; giue ſentence againſt Luther and his Proteſtancie; ſurely Gods word (howſoeuer it may ſeeme to ſome in ſhewe of words) yet indeede &amp; in ſenſe ſtandeth likwiſe on S. Auſtins ſide, and condemneth Luther &amp; the Proteſtant faith. For it can not but ſeeme ſtrange that any wiſe man ſhould imagin that Gods word ſhould ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on the one ſide poſte alone, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pained onely with ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. vice naughtie moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues want of lawfull Miſsion, &amp; right orders, want of approbation of Chriſtianitie, of confeſsion of enemies, of continuance. and of miracles, And on the otherſide with the Diuels word ſhould ſtand learning, vertue, lawfully miſsion, right orders, conſent of Chriſtianitie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsion of Aduerſaries, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance &amp; Miracles. VVould God diſcredit his word with ſuch diſgracefull mates, &amp; countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the diuels word with ſo many &amp; ſo importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t titles of commendation? Or can it ſinke into any mans head that a man ſhould be lawfully ſent, haue the approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtianitie, the confeſsion of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries and Gods teſtimonie by aſſured miracles
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:177762:330"/> (as S. Auſtin is plainly ſhewed to haue had) to preach lyes? Or if I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not obtaine ſo much of ſuch a man, I requeſt him yet this, that he will pleaſe to ſuſpend his iudgment till he ſee the ſecond parte of this Treatice, VVherin (God willing) he ſhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the Catholick religion to goe ſo far beyond the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant for right claime of ſcripture and true ſenſe therof and other true grounds of religion, as he ſeeth it exceed proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy touching the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therof in England in all the points aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. God for his mercies ſake open the eyes of my deere Contryme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may ſee that which is truth. &amp; mooue their harts to embrace &amp; follow that which they ſee to be his euer ſting truth, &amp; their own aeternall happines.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here I wold haue made an end,<note place="margin">An admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to thoſe that think men maie be ſaued in both reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</note> but that I feared that ſome though perſwaded by what hath bene ſhewed in this booke, that the Catholick religion is in all reaſon &amp; wiſdome to be preferred &amp; follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed befor the Proteſtant, may notwithſtanding perſwade them ſelues, that the Proteſtant religion is good ynough &amp; ſufficient to ſaluation, whom I beſeech for God &amp; their owne ſoules ſake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe points following. Firſt, that howſoeuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t religion were a liklie waie to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſith the Catholik faith is incomparably far more liklie, it is no wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſo weightie a matter as is eternall ſaluation or damnation to leaue the more ſecure (if not altogether certaine) waie, and to take the more dangerous. What wiſe man that feareth murthering wil trauel that waie wher he hath iuſt cauſe to think that his enemies lie in waie to kill him, when he maie goe an other waie far more void of fear or danger? what prudent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being to paſſe a dangerous riuer will not chuſe to paſſe rather that waie which manie expert paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers haue vſed theſe thouſand yeares and more, &amp;
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:177762:331"/> by which we are ſure that diuers are ſafely arriued on the other ſide; rather than a new waie which of late ſome vnexpert &amp; iangling fellows haue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined them ſelues to haue found out, but we are not ſure that anie one that hath gone that waie hath eſcaped drowning and is landed in ſafetie on the otherſide? And loue we our ſoules, deſire we heauen, fear we hell, &amp; will we make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie choiſe in religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly I wold haue them to conſider, that it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> euident by what hath bene declared that not onely the Cathol. religion is in all reaſon to be preferred before the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">See <hi>l</hi> 2 <hi>c.</hi> 1. 7 8. 9. 10. &amp; ſeq.</note> but that Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie is indeed no religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a humane deuiſe lately inuented of one man, and him meanly learned, vicious, and for naughtie motiues, diſliked of him ſelf, &amp; at the firſt condemned of all Chriſtendom, and wanting all authoritie of lawfull Miſsion,<note place="margin">See <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>c.</hi> 1</note> of right orders, and Miracles to approue it. Which kind of ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather than religion no man of wiſdom can think ſufficient &amp; able to ſaue him. For nether can Gods religion be an inuention of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but an inſtitution of God him ſelf, nether if it could, were it reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to think that to be a good religion which a naughtie &amp; vnlearned man, vpon naughtie motiues had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, &amp; wanted all authoritie of lawfull miſsion, and right orders to vſe it, yea which not onely all Chriſtendom at the firſt condemned. but euen the inuentor him ſelf for manie yeares diſliked and offered to ſuppreſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly I would haue them to conſider that the Catholik &amp; Proteſtant religion are not one &amp; the ſame religion in ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, differing onely in ſome ſmall points, but are indeed two religions in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. quite oppoſit in many moſt ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of reliigon, namely; In the verie worſhip of God: For Gatholiks beleue that they ought to
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:177762:331"/> worſhip God with externall ſacrifice which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants account ſacriledg: In the verie word of God. For Catholicks beleeue manie books to be diuine as Tobie Eccleſiaſticus Machabees &amp;c. which Proteſtants reiect as fabulous. They are alſo oppoſit in the expoſition of Gods word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in euerie chapter and verſe. They are oppoſit in Gods Sacraments, the catholiks beleeuing ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof the Proteſtant reiecteth fiue.<note place="margin">See l. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 21.</note> Finally to omit manie more great oppoſitions they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit in the foundation it ſelf. <hi>For the foundation head and ſoul.</hi> of Proteſtant religion as them ſelues account, is iuſtification by onely faith, which foundation Catholiks vtterly condemne. How then can anie reaſon which iudgeth the Catholick religion to be good and to come from God, think that a religion ſo oppoſit to it as the Proteſtant is can alſo be good and come from the ſame God: What argreement can ther be betwene Chriſt and Beli all, betwene light and darknes, betwene faith and hereſie. truth and lies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Finally I wold haue them to conſider that not onely infidelitie in vtterly reiecting Chriſt and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> his doctrin, but alſo obſtinat denial of anie one point of his ſacred truth maketh a man an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik and ſubiect to damnation. And as S. Iames ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Gods Commandements, ſo we maie ſaie of Beleef, who offendeth in one point is guiltie of all. <hi>If anie</hi> (ſaith Chriſt Apoc. 22.) <hi>ſhall diminiſh of the words of the book of this prophetie God will take his parte out of the booke of life.</hi>

                  <hi>Vnles a man</hi> (ſaith the Creed of S, Athanaſius) <hi>keep the Catholik faith entire and inuiolate vvithout doubt he ſhall periſh euerlaſtingly.</hi> For as it litle helpeth a man to be ſound in all other members if he be deadly wounded in one. So it litle auaileth one to be ſound in all other points of faith if he be hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:177762:332"/> infected in one.<note place="margin">S. Auſtin.</note> And S.

                  <note place="margin">See S.

That he who deſerueth to be excluded out of the militant Church ſhalbe admitted into the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, who is condemned (as S. Paul ſpeaketh) by his owne iudgment ſhall not be condemned by God, finally who giueth God the lie in one or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie points of his ſacred truth can be in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor and come to his kingdom, No ſurely, wherfor aſſuring our ſelues that as their is but one God and one faith, ſo if the Cath. faith be Chriſts faith Proteſtancie is hereſie if that be the waie to heau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, this is to hel if that be the path to ſaluation this is to damnation, let vs rei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ecting Proteſtancie embrace the Catholik. faith.
